chrome Extention TTY
====================

Through a serial communication port, this APP is used to 
comunicate with our 328eforth burned onto the flash memory
of an Atmega328p cpu chip on the Arduino UNO.

From my Window 7, before connecting to the chip, the 
**baudrate** and **port** should be given correctly. (The
**port** could be picked among available options as well).
